Dear Valued Customers and Partners,

As a pioneering starship parts manufacturing company, we understand the critical role that rocket boosters play in the success of space exploration missions. It is with a heavy heart that we must address the current challenges we face due to an unexpected loss in space transportation.

In recent months, our industry has encountered an unprecedented setback â€“ the loss of one of our transportation vehicles in space. This unfortunate incident has led to a shortage of rocket boosters, impacting not only our company but also the broader space exploration community.

Rocket boosters are the lifeline of any space mission, providing the necessary thrust to propel spacecraft beyond Earth's atmosphere and into the vast expanse of the cosmos. Whether it's launching satellites into orbit, resupplying the International Space Station, or embarking on ambitious interplanetary voyages, rocket boosters are indispensable components that enable these endeavors.

The loss of a transportation vehicle has disrupted the supply chain, causing delays in the production and delivery of rocket boosters. This shortage has ripple effects across the industry, affecting scheduled launches, research projects, and commercial ventures alike. Moreover, it underscores the inherent risks and challenges associated with space exploration, reminding us of the need for resilience and innovation in the face of adversity.

As we navigate these challenges, our commitment to our customers and partners remains unwavering. We are actively working to mitigate the impact of the rocket booster shortage by implementing contingency plans, optimizing production processes, and exploring alternative solutions. Our team of engineers and technicians is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of quality and reliability in every component we manufacture.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of collaboration and cooperation within the space industry. By working together with our peers, government agencies, and research institutions, we can leverage collective expertise and resources to overcome obstacles and drive progress in space exploration.

While the road ahead may be challenging, we remain steadfast in our mission to push the boundaries of possibility and advance the frontiers of space exploration. Together, we will rise to the occasion, adapt to changing circumstances, and continue to propel humanity towards new horizons.

We thank you for your continued support and understanding during this time of uncertainty. Rest assured, we are committed to overcoming the rocket booster shortage and emerging stronger, more resilient, and more innovative than ever before.

Sincerely,

Orion Spacecraft Components
